/**
 * Make sure to use FP_ATTRIB on all functions that are loaded from
 * Android (bionic libc) libraries to make sure floating point arguments
 * are passed the right way.
 *
 * See: http://wiki.debian.org/ArmHardFloatPort/VfpComparison
 *      http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Function-Attributes.html
 *
 * It doesn't hurt to have it added for non-floating point arguments and
 * return types, even though it does not really have any effect.
 *
 * If you use the convenience macros in hybris/internal/binding.h, your
 * wrapper functions will automatically make use of this attribute.
