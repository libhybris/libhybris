/**
 * Definition of the axis
 * ----------------------
 *
 * This API is relative to the screen of the device in its default orientation,
 * that is, if the device can be used in portrait or landscape, this API
 * is only relative to the NATURAL orientation of the screen. In other words,
 * the axis are not swapped when the device's screen orientation changes.
 * Higher level services /may/ perform this transformation.

 *           |/ z>0 (toward the sky)
 *
 *    O: Origin (x=0,y=0,z=0)
 *
 *
 * SENSOR_TYPE_ORIENTATION
 * -----------------------
 * 
 * All values are angles in degrees.
 * 
 * Orientation sensors return sensor events for all 3 axes at a constant
 * rate defined by setDelay().
 *
 * azimuth: angle between the magnetic north direction and the Y axis, around 
 *  the Z axis (0<=azimuth<360).
 *      0=North, 90=East, 180=South, 270=West
 * 
 * pitch: Rotation around X axis (-180<=pitch<=180), with positive values when
 *  the z-axis moves toward the y-axis.
 *
 * roll: Rotation around Y axis (-90<=roll<=90), with positive values when
 *  the x-axis moves towards the z-axis.
 *
 * Note: For historical reasons the roll angle is positive in the clockwise
 *  direction (mathematically speaking, it should be positive in the
 *  counter-clockwise direction):
 *
 *                Z
 *                ^
 *  (+roll)  .--> |
 *          /     |
 *         |      |  roll: rotation around Y axis
 *     X <-------(.)
 *                 Y
 *       note that +Y == -roll
 *
 *
 *
 * Note: This definition is different from yaw, pitch and roll used in aviation
 *  where the X axis is along the long side of the plane (tail to nose).
 *  
 *  
 * SENSOR_TYPE_ACCELEROMETER
 * -------------------------
 *
 *  All values are in SI units (m/s^2) and measure the acceleration of the
 *  device minus the force of gravity.
 *  
 *  Acceleration sensors return sensor events for all 3 axes at a constant
 *  rate defined by setDelay().
 *
 *  x: Acceleration minus Gx on the x-axis 
 *  y: Acceleration minus Gy on the y-axis 
 *  z: Acceleration minus Gz on the z-axis
 *  
 *  Examples:
 *    When the device lies flat on a table and is pushed on its left side
 *    toward the right, the x acceleration value is positive.
 *    
 *    When the device lies flat on a table, the acceleration value is +9.81,
 *    which correspond to the acceleration of the device (0 m/s^2) minus the
 *    force of gravity (-9.81 m/s^2).
 *    
 *    When the device lies flat on a table and is pushed toward the sky, the
 *    acceleration value is greater than +9.81, which correspond to the
 *    acceleration of the device (+A m/s^2) minus the force of 
 *    gravity (-9.81 m/s^2).
 *    
 *    
 * SENSOR_TYPE_MAGNETIC_FIELD
 * --------------------------
 * 
 *  All values are in micro-Tesla (uT) and measure the ambient magnetic
 *  field in the X, Y and Z axis.
 *
 *  Magnetic Field sensors return sensor events for all 3 axes at a constant
 *  rate defined by setDelay().
 *
 * SENSOR_TYPE_GYROSCOPE
 * ---------------------
 *
 *  All values are in radians/second and measure the rate of rotation
 *  around the X, Y and Z axis.  The coordinate system is the same as is
 *  used for the acceleration sensor. Rotation is positive in the
 *  counter-clockwise direction (right-hand rule). That is, an observer
 *  looking from some positive location on the x, y or z axis at a device
 *  positioned on the origin would report positive rotation if the device
 *  appeared to be rotating counter clockwise. Note that this is the
 *  standard mathematical definition of positive rotation and does not agree
 *  with the definition of roll given earlier.
 *  The range should at least be 17.45 rad/s (ie: ~1000 deg/s).
 *
 * SENSOR_TYPE_PROXIMITY
 * ----------------------
 *
 * The distance value is measured in centimeters.  Note that some proximity
 * sensors only support a binary "close" or "far" measurement.  In this case,
 * the sensor should report its maxRange value in the "far" state and a value
 * less than maxRange in the "near" state.
 *
 * Proximity sensors report a value only when it changes and each time the
 * sensor is enabled.
 *
 * SENSOR_TYPE_LIGHT
 * -----------------
 *
 * The light sensor value is returned in SI lux units.
 *
 * Light sensors report a value only when it changes and each time the
 * sensor is enabled.
 *
 * SENSOR_TYPE_PRESSURE
 * --------------------
 *
 * The pressure sensor return the athmospheric pressure in hectopascal (hPa)
 *
 * Pressure sensors report events at a constant rate defined by setDelay().
 *
 * SENSOR_TYPE_GRAVITY
 * -------------------
 *
 * A gravity output indicates the direction of and magnitude of gravity in
 * the devices's coordinates.  On Earth, the magnitude is 9.8 m/s^2.
 * Units are m/s^2.  The coordinate system is the same as is used for the
 * acceleration sensor. When the device is at rest, the output of the
 * gravity sensor should be identical to that of the accelerometer.
 *
 * SENSOR_TYPE_LINEAR_ACCELERATION
 * --------------------------------
 *
 * Indicates the linear acceleration of the device in device coordinates,
 * not including gravity.
 * This output is essentially Acceleration - Gravity.  Units are m/s^2.
 * The coordinate system is the same as is used for the acceleration sensor.
 *
 *
 * SENSOR_TYPE_ROTATION_VECTOR
 * ---------------------------
 *
 * A rotation vector represents the orientation of the device as a combination
 * of an angle and an axis, in which the device has rotated through an angle
 * theta around an axis <x, y, z>. The three elements of the rotation vector
 * are <x*sin(theta/2), y*sin(theta/2), z*sin(theta/2)>, such that the magnitude
 * of the rotation vector is equal to sin(theta/2), and the direction of the
 * rotation vector is equal to the direction of the axis of rotation. The three
 * elements of the rotation vector are equal to the last three components of a
 * unit quaternion <cos(theta/2), x*sin(theta/2), y*sin(theta/2), z*sin(theta/2)>.
 * Elements of the rotation vector are unitless.  The x, y, and z axis are defined
 * in the same was as for the acceleration sensor.
 *
 * The reference coordinate system is defined as a direct orthonormal basis,
 * where:
 *
 * - X is defined as the vector product Y.Z (It is tangential to
 * the ground at the device's current location and roughly points East).
 *
 * - Y is tangential to the ground at the device's current location and
 * points towards the magnetic North Pole.
 *
 * - Z points towards the sky and is perpendicular to the ground.
 *
 *
 * The rotation-vector is stored as:
 *
 *   sensors_event_t.data[0] = x*sin(theta/2)
 *   sensors_event_t.data[1] = y*sin(theta/2)
 *   sensors_event_t.data[2] = z*sin(theta/2)
 *   sensors_event_t.data[3] =   cos(theta/2)
 *
 *
 * SENSOR_TYPE_RELATIVE_HUMIDITY
 * ------------------------------
 *
 * A relative humidity sensor measures relative ambient air humidity and
 * returns a value in percent.
 *
 * Relative humidity sensors report a value only when it changes and each
 * time the sensor is enabled.
 *
 *
 * SENSOR_TYPE_AMBIENT_TEMPERATURE
 * -------------------------------
 *
 * The ambient (room) temperature in degree Celsius.
 *
 * Temperature sensors report a value only when it changes and each time the
 * sensor is enabled.
 *
